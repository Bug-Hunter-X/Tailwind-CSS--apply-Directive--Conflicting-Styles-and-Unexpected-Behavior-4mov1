To fix this, ensure that your overriding class is more specific. This can be done by:

1. **Adding a more specific class name:** For example, you could rename the overriding class to something more specific, such as `my-element-width-override`. This increases the specificity of the style and the override will work correctly.

2. **Using the `!important` flag:** As a less clean option, you can add `!important` to the style you want to ensure overrides, but this is generally discouraged as it can lead to maintenance issues.  Avoid this if possible.

```css
/* styles.css */
.custom-width { @apply w-64; }
.custom-width-override { @apply w-32; }

/* Use a more specific class here */
.my-element { @apply custom-width my-element-width-override; }

/*OR - Avoid using !important*/
/*.my-element { @apply custom-width custom-width-override!important; }*/
```
By fixing the specificity and avoiding ambiguous class names, the expected style will be applied correctly.
