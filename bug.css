This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with custom utility classes that have conflicting styles.  For example:

```css
/* styles.css */
.custom-width { @apply w-64; }
.custom-width-override { @apply w-32; }

.my-element { @apply custom-width custom-width-override; }
```

The expected behavior is that `.my-element` should have a width of 32 units because the `custom-width-override` class is applied last. However, in some cases (depending on the order of classes and potentially other factors like CSS specificity), `w-64` might override `w-32`, resulting in the element being 64 units wide instead.
